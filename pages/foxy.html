                    <h2>Foxy the Pirate</h2>
                    <p>Foxy is a discontinued animatronic pirate fox entertainer. He resides at his own separate stage in the pizzeria. He was the pirate fox entertainer when the first Freddy Fazbear's Pizza was opened in 1983 (although, it's unknown if he was discontinued).</p>
                    <p>Foxy is a large, animatronic fox with crimson, tattered fur. He has yellow eyes, red eyebrows, and three strands of hair from the top of his head. He has a hook for his right hand and his left hand has been worn down to the endoskeleton. He also bears an eye patch that is folded over his right eye, although he is usually seen with it above his eye rather than covering it. Unlike the stereotypical fox, Foxy doesn't have a tail.</p>
                    <p>As the title of Foxy's attraction would imply, Foxy's personality is that of a stereotypical pirate, often speaking in pirate slang, all with a pirate accent.</p>
