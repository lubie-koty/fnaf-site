                    <h2>Bonnie the Rabbit</h2>
                    <p>Bonnie is an animatronic rabbit and the guitarist in Freddy's band, positioned at the left side of the stage. He was the guitarist when the first Freddy Fazbear's Pizza was opened in 1983.</p>
                    <p>Bonnie is an indigo-colored animatronic rabbit with blue accents, magenta eyes and a squarish muzzle. The color from his muzzle, stomach, and insides of his ears is a lavender color. He sports long articulated ears that are capable of bending backwards and forwards and wears a red bowtie with a neck strap that is partially obstructed by his chin. Onstage, he carries a dark red guitar (most likely modeled after the Gibson Flying V). Unlike the other characters, he has round teeth and lacks eyebrows.</p>
                    <p>The Freddy Fazbear's Pizza Theme Song reveals Bonnie to have a personality based on a rock musician; boastful, prideful, with the speech pattern of a laid back hippie stereotype.</p>
