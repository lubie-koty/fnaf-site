                    <h2>Freddy Fazbear</h2>
                    <p>Freddy is an animatronic bear and the star attraction of the original Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, as well as the face and namesake of the company that owns it- Fazbear Entertainment. Freddy takes the role of lead singer and overall performer of the band, standing in the center of the stage.</p>
                    <p>Freddy is a brown animatronic bear with a lighter shade of brown on both his stomach and puffy muzzle. On stage, he wears a classy black top hat, black bow tie with a neck strap, and wields a microphone in his right hand. He has thick black eyebrows, three-toed feet, and three black freckles on both sides of his muzzle. On his palms and underneath his fingers, he has what appears to be paw-like prints. His round ears are articulated and are thus able to move backwards and forward.</p>
                    <p>Freddy Fazbear officially debuted as an animatronic mascot when the original Freddy Fazbear's Pizza was opened in 1983.</p>
